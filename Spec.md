# Little Library

## Goals
*	Encourage reading habit in my kids (9 and 7 yr olds)
*	Enable financial literacy – Income, Expense, Savings.

## Approach
* Our apartment has 140 houses, with many kids of similar age group as my kids. 
* Our apartment doesn’t have a library as such in the club house.
* I will setup a small library and make it available for the kids in the apartment.

## Key scenarios
* Admin to be able to add books (Crud on books)
* Admin to be able to add users (Crud on users)
  * Users will be charged a monthly membership (let’s say 100 Rs per month; but admin should be able to configure and include any “offers” time to time)
*	Admin to be able to issue books and take book returns
  *	Admin should be able to send reminders on their Whatsapp if needed for delayed book returns
  *	Admin should be able to charge extra for any damaged books
*	Admin should be able to manage money and see balance sheet any time
  *	Initial investment
  *	For monthly membership fees
  *	Able to enter expenses like marketing, buying new books, etc

## Tech stack
* App should be deployed on my Azure account and be usable on Laptop, tablet, mobile browsers, by the Admin only.
* All the code should be regularly checked in private GitHub repo. Steps to setup, build and deploy should be very clearly documented.
* UX should be extremely simple and light
* Should be built with API-first design

## Maintenance
* Maintenance for the app should be provided for at least 6 months.
* Support for potential future features
* Providing app access to the users for browsing and searching books etc.,
